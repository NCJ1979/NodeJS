	NO MATTER HOW WE MODULARIZE JS, AS LONG AS IT IS IN ONE FILE, IT WILL STILL BE DOWNLOADED.  SO FIRST, WE NEED TO BREAK INTO FILES.
	SECOND, AFTER BREAKING INTO FILES, DEFINE ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER MODULES USING define(), WHICH IS PROBABLY THE ONLY GLOGAL DEFINITION.
	
	CALLERS, WILL USE require() TO INVOKE MODULES AND PROCEED.  REQUIREJS WILL INTURN LOAD MODULES/DEPENDENCIES IN THE RIGHT ORDER FROM
	VARIOUS JS FILES.  THIS IS THE CRUX OF THE REQUIREJS / ASYNCHRONOUS MODULE DEFINITION. (AMD)


	RequireJS also assumes by default that all dependencies are scripts.  So it does not expect to see a trailing ".js"
	
	1. What is the max number of module defintions per file?
		There should only be ONE module definition per file on disk.  -- define()
		
	2. Is there any difference between the top-level require call and a require call within a define( )?
		 The top-level require has a signature require(['module'], function(module) {} );
		 
		 The require inside a define() would have var a = require('modA');
			But, make sure require and modA are defined as dependencies.  
			eg; define(['require', 'modA'], function(require)
					{
						var modA = require('modA');
					}
				);
				
	3. What happens in the following case:
			eg; define(['require'], function(require)
					{
						var modA = require('modA');
					}
				);
	
		If fails, because, IF YOU PASS DEPENDENCIES ARRAY, THEN WE ARE HARD-CODING ALL THE DEPENDENCIES.  TO FIX IT, DO THE FOLLOWING:
		
				define(function(require)
					{
						var modA = require('modA');
					}
				);
