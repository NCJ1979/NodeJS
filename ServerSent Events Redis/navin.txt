WHAT IS REDIS?

Redis is a very powerful tool that can be used widely in building 
especially a large scaling system, as a distributed cache, NoSQL and message queue.

Linux and OSX are the two operating systems where Redis is developed and more tested.
The Windows version need Visual Studio to complile and generate the exe to start the redis server.

Without Redis, our examples cannot be tested.
