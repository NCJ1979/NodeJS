It's all too easy to create JavaScript applications that end up as 
tangled piles of jQuery selectors and callbacks, all trying frantically to keep 
data in sync between the HTML UI, your JavaScript logic, and the database on your server. 

(MVC)

Models:			Created, validated, destroyed, and saved to the server.
Collections:
Views:			Display the model's data are notified of the event, causing them to re-render


You don't have to write the glue code that looks into the DOM to find an element with a specific id, 
and update the HTML manually — when the model changes, the views simply update themselves.
