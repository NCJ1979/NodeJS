node-gyp is a cross-platform command-line tool written in Node.js for 
compiling native addon modules for Node.js, which takes away the pain 
of dealing with the various differences in build platforms. 
It is the replacement to the node-waf program which is removed for node v0.8.

THAT MEANS, WHEN YOU INSTALL A MODULE WHICH HAS NATIVE LIBS, NODE-GYP KICKS
IN TO ENSURE THE LIB IS COMPILED FOR THE PLATFORM.

c:\data\program files\nodejs\nodevars.bat

It sets the following lines to include node-gyp which is in app-data DIR to the SYSTEM PATH.

rem Ensure this Node.js and npm are first in the PATH
set PATH=%APPDATA%\npm;%~dp0;%PATH%



npm install -g node-gyp@latest		[INSTALL NODE-GYP GLOBALLY (APP DATA DIR) ]
